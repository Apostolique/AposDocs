# Best practices
This page will document my recommended best practices. Note that the first rule of best practices is that there are no best practices.

## File name

File names should use kebab-case such as `best-practices.md`.

## Title

A page's title should be at the top of a markdown file. Only capitalize the first letter. It is preceded by a single `#` and a space.

```md
# Best practices
```

## Description

Each page should have a description. It should directly follow the title. It should be shorter than 160 characters.

```md
